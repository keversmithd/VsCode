    Find the union and intersection of the sets \{1,3,5,7,9\} and \{2,3,5,7\} }\\\text{
    If S = \{1,3,5,7,9\} and P = \{2,3,5,7\} then }\\\text{
    S }\cup\text{ P = \{1,2,3,5,7,9\} and S }\cap\text{ P = \{3,5,7\} }\\\text{
    The union is all unique members of both sets combined into one set. }\\\text{
    The intersection is all members of both sets which are the same. }\\\text{
